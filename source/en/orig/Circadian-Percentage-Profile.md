* To enable Circadian Percentage Profile go to the Config Builder and select Enabled and Visible
* In the Circadian Percentage Profile menu (CPP) enter your base profile.  This is the default that the pump reverts to when not looping.  This profile can be modified in two ways:
  * Timeshift - this moves everything round the clock by the number of hours entered.  So for example, when working night shifts change the number of hours to how much later/earlier you go to bed or wake up.
  * Percentage - this  applies the same percentage to all parameters. If you set it to 130% (meaning you are 30% more insulin resistant), it will up the basal rate by 30%. It will also lower the ISF and IC accordingly (divide by 1.3 in this example).  It will be sent to the pump and then be the default basal rate. The loop algorithm (open or closed) will continue to work on top of the selected percentage profile.  So for example separate percentage profiles can be set up for different stages of the hormone cycle.
